## Labyrinth Game

Our project contains uses 3 different algorithms to generate mazes.
We seperated the game into two modes:
### Generation mode
This mode slowly shows how each algorithm generates the maze.

### Game mode
In the game mode, you can play the maze by moving a character with w,a,s,d. If you're having solving the maze, there's a resolution mode using A* to solve the maze.

To understand the code, we created a [WIKI](https://github.com/NathanAnto/NathAnto_VIncCord_Labyrinth/wiki) that explains most classes and functions.
